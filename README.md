# Solving ONAT coding problems

This is an incomplete repo full of solved code problems found on the ONAT website with Haskell programming language.

You can get the list of assignments [here](https://metod.onat.edu.ua/download/153).

I hope these problems will be helpful for you to practice and review. If you have practiced on or designed a brighter way of solving any specific problem, I'd love to see it! Open a PR or issue with your suggestions or optimizations.
